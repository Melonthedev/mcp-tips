# MCP Tips
Some useful tips for coding with the minecraft source code generated by mcp

## Getting started
Just configure your project here: [MCP-Reborn](https://github.com/Hexeption/MCP-Reborn)

If you want to code a client, you should maybe switch to fabric because MCP-Reborn is not really supported and rearding its repo's warning: "You CANNOT publish any code generated by this tool."
Fabric changes unlike Forge nearly nothing on the GUI side. Your code can be ported to newer versions with seemingly less effort than your mcp code would take. It also makes your client compatible with other mods.

## Newer Versions
#### I tried to use newer versions of mcp-reborn recently but I noticed that there were few to no tutorials or help on the internet. So I just wanted to share my basic knowledge here for anyone who hasn't figured out some things in the newer versions


Before we get started: 
You will often find solutions to your problems if you search for them in forge or fabric forums. Some things might be different but you will find similarities. 

The `Minecraft` class is often the main entry point if you try to do somethig basic. I will use this class often here. 
You can get the instance with `Minecraft.getInstance()`.  
It's possible that some fields are private, just change them to public if needed.  
This is not a good practise though. If you use your code in newer versions, you would have to change the modifiers there too.

#### PoseStack:  
PoseStack is used by the new rendersystem, you will probably see it often.  
It's like Forge-Mapping's MatrixStack but it has a different name.
Getting:   
In most cases the poseStack is already given as a method parameter, if so just use this. It is probably named like `p_92745_` or something.  
If it's not already passed, you can create a new Instance with `new PoseStack()` but avoid it. In this case I would probably get it by calling `RenderSystem.getModelViewStack();`  
Usage:  
You can modify the rendering of objects with it, for example you can scale it etc.  
To use it call `stack.pushPose()` and when you finished `stack.popPose()`  

So lets get started.

- Drawing Text
```java
Minecraft.getInstance().font.draw(poseStack, text, x, y, color);
//Example:
Minecraft.getInstance().font.draw(poseStack, "Hello World", 100, height / 2, 0xFFFFFF); // would draw a Hello World in white at x position 100 and at the hight of the screen split in half
```

- Getting the scaled resolution
```java
//Width
Minecraft.getInstance().getWindow().getGuiScaledWidth()
//Height
Minecraft.getInstance().getWindow().getGuiScaledHeight()

//ScreenWidth
Minecraft.getInstance().getWindow().getScreenWidth()
//ScreenHeight
Minecraft.getInstance().getWindow().getScreenHeight()
```

- More things with getWindow()
```java
Window window = Minecraft.getInstance().getWindow();
//Set Title
window.setTitle("Minnekkraftt");
//Find best monitor
window.findBestMonitor();
//Toggle Fullscreen
window.toggleFullScreen();
//Toggle Windowed
window.setWindowed(int, int);

//Set screen width and height
window.setWidth(int) & window.setHeight(int)
```

- Get Player, Serverdata and World
```java
Minecraft.getInstance().player; //Player
Minecraft.getInstance().clientLevel; //World (Level)
Minecraft.getInstance().getCurrentServer() //Serverdata with onlineplayers, ip, version, motd, ping, icon, etc.
```

- Components  
To use text in some methods you need a Component, tho not the java Component.  
This is the import you need: `import net.minecraft.network.chat.Component;`  
To get an empty component: `Component.empty()`  
To get a text component: `Component.literal("TEXT")`  
To get a translatable component: `Component.translatable("menu.pause")`   
To get a keybind component: `Component.keybind()`; Usage: `Component.keybind(Minecraft.getInstance().options.keyKEY.getName())`  
To style a component: `Component.(...).withStyle(ChatFormatting.COLOR)`  

- Create Screen, add buttons, sliders and open screens  
Create a new Class, I would call it `YourguinameScreen` which extends Screen and implements/overrides some of the methods.   
The super constructor needs a component, explained above.  
In the `init` method you can initialize the screen, here is where you add your buttons etc.  
In the `render` method you get a PoseStack, mouseX, mouseY and partialTicks passed. Here is where you render text and draw the background or render images  
```java
import com.mojang.blaze3d.vertex.PoseStack;
import net.minecraft.client.gui.components.AbstractSliderButton;
import net.minecraft.client.gui.components.Button;
import net.minecraft.client.gui.screens.Screen;
import net.minecraft.client.gui.screens.inventory.InventoryScreen;
import net.minecraft.network.chat.Component;

public class TutorialScreen extends Screen {

    //Constructor, here you handle the fields etc.
    protected TutorialScreen() {
        super(Component.literal("My Screen"));
    }

    //Initializes the screen, add buttons here
    @Override
    protected void init() {
        //Add Button - 3rd and 4th arg is the size of the button
        addRenderableWidget(new Button(this.width / 2, this.height / 2, 98, 20, Component.literal("My Button"), (p_96323_) -> {
            //Do whatever the button should do
            System.out.println("Hello, I was clicked");
        }));

        //Add Slider - last argument is the max value
        addRenderableWidget(new AbstractSliderButton(this.width / 2, this.height / 2, 98, 20, Component.literal("My Button"), 1) {
            @Override
            protected void updateMessage() {
                //You got a value variable which is the current value of the slider, you can visualize it like that:
                setMessage(Component.literal("Value: " + value));
            }

            @Override
            protected void applyValue() {
                //This just applies the value, used for saving value or doing whatever the slider should do
            }
        });
    }

    @Override
    public boolean mouseClicked(double x, double y, int button) {
        return super.mouseClicked(x, y, button);
        //button == 0 -> leftclick
        //button == 1 -> rightclick
    }

    @Override
    public void render(PoseStack stack, int mouseX, int mouseY, float partialTicks) {
        super.render(stack, mouseX, mouseY, partialTicks);
        //Drawing Background
        super.renderBackground(stack);
        //Drawing Title
        drawCenteredString(stack, this.font, this.title, this.width / 2, 15, 16777215);
        //Draw or Render whatever you want, for example the player:
        if (minecraft.player != null)
            InventoryScreen.renderEntityInInventory(width - width/8, height/3 + 100, 75, 1.0f, 1.0f, this.minecraft.player);
    }

    @Override
    public void onClose() {
        super.onClose();
        System.out.println("Goodbye");
    }

    //Weather the screen should pause the game if shown
    @Override
    public boolean isPauseScreen() {
        return false;
    }
}

```

- Customize the loading/splash screen
The screen you are looking for is called `LoadingOverlay` and is an overlay. 
You can do most things like in a normal screen tho you have to make sure the objects you use are initialized. 
For example if you want to draw a string on the screen you have to make sure that Minecraft.font/fontManager/textureManager is initialized 
or else it won't work as you want it to. If you want to draw an image you can just copy Mojang's approach and add a custom image loader. 
If you have trouble with the colors of custom added images, call `RenderSystem.defaultBlendFunc();` before rendering the image.

If you want to change the background color look at the field `LOGO_BACKGROUND_COLOR`. There you can change the RGB value. 
`LOGO_BACKGROUND_COLOR_DARK` is the dark color which will be used if monochrome logo is enabled in options. You could customize that too.


If I find small useful tricks I will update this.  
I hope I helped some of you a bit :)
